      	<div class="entry_summary">I really love when I'm browsing my feed and I bump into something that take my breath away. And this happened Yesterday when I saw  Nigel Cox's work on Minimalissimo. Nigel Cox was born in Ireland and used to draw cartoons and superheroes from comics as a child. Nigel calls his style "photorealistic minimalism" and as you will be able to see here, his paintings are superb. 
Nigel delivers an universe that suck us into a different reality and makes us live the reality we are seeing. It's almost magic. There is no way you can not get interested about his characters. Besides being super realistic the delicate lines and colors are amazing. Definitely worth checking out.   















Make sure to check out Nigel's website for more information.

Marshall Amp Fridge


Mix your love of rock with your love of beer in an all new way with the Marshall Amp Fridge. Carrying Jim Marshall's signature logos and facing, and control knobs that go to eleven, you'd be hard pressed to notice it's a fridge, but if you do, inside you'll find 4.4 cubic feet of space, can-specific storage, and a high efficiency freezer. Speaker to play "Cold as Ice" every time you open the door not included. (at Uncrate)
Paypal Here: Mobile Credit Card Reader


Being the online leader in electronic payments, PayPal has just launched a new mobile payment system called PayPal Here. The triangle-shaped device plugs into your smartphone’s earphone jack and lets anyone accept credit cards. Designed by Yves Behar of fuseproject, the triangle front slides down to prevent the device from spinning around while swiping the card.
The tiny credit card reader is simple to use and features encryption to prevent theft. Charging 2.7% per transaction, PayPal Here is perfect for small business owners looking to increase business by accepting credit cards and having a smaller fee to pay. The card reader and the app that runs it are free.

Plug Lamp





By integrating the socket in the lamp it also takes away that annoying process of searching for a socket or having to unplug something in order to access an electrical point. Plug Lamp has a bulbous shape with a base in molded powder coated aluminium and the plug socket displayed centrally, making it a decorative detail. The light itself is concealed by an opal glass shade and is dimmable. (at Moco Loco)
"Hard drive" 8GB Flash drive


Now this is definitely a hoot – a USB flash drive that was specially manufactured to have it resemble – visually at least, a hard drive. Yes sir, who does not want something this cute in the first place? It will be a definite conversation starter, never mind the fact that it will never come close to offering the kind of storage capacities that hard drives deliver. Taiwanese firm InfoThink is behind the design of this rather ingenious computer peripheral, but we are not too pleased to see it come with just USB 2.0 connectivity.
One would have thought that by now, we would have been able to see USB 3.0 connectivity being the norm, whether as ports on most home computers as well as peripherals in the industry. I guess I am wrong in this aspect – USB 2.0 still holds quite the sway across the general populace, and USB 2.0 it is with this 8GB USB flash drive. (at Coolest Gadgets)
LG Mouse Scanner





Portable, easy to use, OCR editing, scanning of multiple sizes, and real-time sharing. LG Mouse Scanner is the world's first mouse with an embedded scanner function that offers convience, mobility and simplicity to users. Now users can perform OCR editing of scanned files as well as sending them as e-mails, Social Networking Sites and mobile phones. From the offices of global companies to daily life, the LG Mouse Scanner will transform scanning into a much easier and more convenient task. (at )
